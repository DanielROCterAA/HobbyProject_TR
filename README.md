# HobbyProject_TR
this is a small hobby project of my were I will be spending some of my free time on.

Game Concept:

Fan game idea with a modular story narrative?
In a beat em up gameplay like Solas City Heroes, Pure Onyx hentai scenes/ animations inspired by it

Character from taimanin team up, the idea is that the player chooses one of the three taimanin ninjas to play as the main character and their story the other 2 will become story support or just companions that get effected by the story/ gameplay.
